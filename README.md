# romhacking

This project falls under fair use due to its transformative nature of the source material.

I spent six months reverse engineering the SNES game Live-A-Live. This project is a documentation of the progress.

Goal:
  -disassembly and reverse engineering of the source material

Tools used:
  -MESEN-S
  -Lunar IPS (Patching tool)
  -Aeon Genesis's 2.0 English patched ROM of Live A Live
  -several Japanese websites which dealt with the static data within the game's files
  
What was accomplished:
  -Text editing, plus insertion of customized text
  -Labeling/marking important addresses within the game's ROM
  -Learning and understanding basic 65c816 (SNES assembly language)
  -Learned hex editing
  -Editing item properties within the game
  -Created unofficial English table used in Live A Live text editing
 
Impact:
  -Influenced growth of small  Live A Live ROMhacking community
  -Helped others ROMhack Live a Live
  -Helped discover and label several important addresses
  -Contributed to the current understanding on how data is stored and used within the game's ROM
